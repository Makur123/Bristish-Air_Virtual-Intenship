# British Air Virtual Internship

Welcome to the British Air Virtual Internship repository! This project showcases my journey and accomplishments during the Data Science Simulations Internship focused on enhancing British Airways' customer experience.

## Project Overview

In this virtual internship, I completed two main tasks designed to provide valuable insights and improve operational efficiency for British Airways.

### Task 1: Web Scraping to Gain Company Insights

**Business Problem:**  
British Airways aims to understand how customers perceive their service to enhance operations and customer satisfaction.

**Solution:**  
I utilized the BeautifulSoup library to scrape customer reviews and service ratings from [Airline Quality](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways). The extracted data was then analyzed to provide actionable insights.

### Task 2: Customer Booking Data Analysis

**Business Problem:**  
British Airways wants to generate insights about customer satisfaction and train a machine learning model using booking data.

**Solution:**  
I analyzed customer booking data to derive insights on customer satisfaction. Additionally, I trained a machine learning model to predict customer satisfaction based on the booking data.
